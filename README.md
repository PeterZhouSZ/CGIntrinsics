# CGIntrinsics
This is the CGIntrinsics implementation described in the paper "CGIntrinsics: Better Intrinsic Image Decomposition through Physically-Based Rendering, Z. Li and N. Snavely, ECCV 2018" (Still Updating, please stay tune). The code skeleton is based on "https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix" and "https://github.com/lixx2938/unsupervised-learning-intrinsic-images".
